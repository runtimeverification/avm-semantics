## Try KAVM

### How to install KAVM

#### Install kup tool

The easiest way to install KAVM is provided by the kup tool. To install kup, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
bash <(curl https://kframework.org/install)
```

The installation script will guide you through a simple process that will also install Nix on your system. Once the previous command finishes, which may take some time, `kup` should be available in your shell. To verify the installation, execute:

```
kup list
```

The result should look similar to the following screenshot:

Once `kup` is installed, we can proceed to installing `kavm` itself.

#### Install KAVM

In the screenshot above, we see kup reporting that the `kavm` package is available for installation. Proceed by typing `kup install kavm` to install it:

The installation process may take some time, since `kavm` will be built from source, together with its dependencies (can we provide a cached build?).
